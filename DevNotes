Timer set for 9 am/pm to trigger function to clean database, with lastCleaned date on db, also called at app launch, return fromm background, with local lastCleaned as well

look @ keyChain for passwords - store & generate

UIRestoration -> scrollPosition x 2, last entries in addEditCon

local fallback for station list


abandoned table sectionIndexTitles - but: possibly add empty string after each title for spacing?? but adds lots of complexity elsewhere

could move inOut status logic into custom view with own nib, like this: https://medium.com/theappspace/swift-custom-uiview-with-xib-file-211bb8bbd6eb

investigate db keepSynched: would that prevent new/added notifs when returning from add/edit vuCon? OTOH: going to / coming from background we need the full monty anyway

priority textField: color background for urgency - call / label "Urgency"??

if ever going to iOS 10: remove observers!

supress long press on section header (edits first item in section?)

should show something - BG image? - indicating no current requests in table view
